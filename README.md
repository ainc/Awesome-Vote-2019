## Introduction
   
![Alt text](/assets/images/5-Across-Logo.png?raw=true "Title")

~~The Awesome Vote app was created to provide a unique and useful
way to upload and vote on pitch ideas from one's own mobile device.
Loosely based on awesome-vote (2016), the former Mean.js-based
application.~~

With the recent death of the awesome-vote project of 2016, a desire
for a new way to connect with 5Across participants has come about. 
Thus the idea for the 5Across voting game app was developed. The
idea of the game is to allow users to "bet" points on the 5 ideas 
being pitched. If they bet correctly, they will generate more points,
allowing them to bet even more at the next event. This will generate
excitement for the vent and motivate attendees to come back again.

Possible features include uploading data about current pitches, voting
on ideas, accumulating points, and a leaderboard of users with the
most points.

This app uses Google's Flutter app development API, along with 
Cloud Firestore and Authentication of Firebase as its backend database. 
This allows for the data stored by the app to eventually be ported to
a supplementary website/app if wanted, along with allowing users from 
all OS's to play nicely together.
