## Introduction
   
![Alt text](/assets/images/5-Across-Logo.png?raw=true "Title")

The Awesome Vote app was created to provide a unique and useful
way to upload and vote on pitch ideas from one's own mobile device.
Loosely based on awesome-vote (2016), the former Mean.js-based
application.

This app uses Google's Flutter app development API, along with 
Firebase as its backend databse.
